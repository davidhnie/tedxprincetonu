            	<img src="bp17.jpg" style="height: 22vh; float: right;" /> <span class="emph">Brooks Powell ’17</span>, is a junior in Princeton's Religion Department. He focuses primarily on ethics and ethical theory and is currently writing an independent paper on the Christian ethics of alcohol. During a neuroscience class his sophomore year, Brooks came across recent literature in the Journal of Neuroscience revealing properties of a naturally occurring organic compound that mitigates chemical withdrawal and tolerance to alcohol. Working with a pharmaceutical company to turn this into a consumer product, Brooks started a company called Thrive+. Since launching his junior fall, Thrive+ has been covered by The Huffington Post, Inc. Magazine, The Trenton Times, and more. Thrive+’s customers include currently competing US Olympic gold medalists, professional baseball players, and Oxford Ph.D. students. Being right in the middle of alcohol’s $200+ billion dollar industry, Brooks thinks a lot about the ethics surrounding humankind’s interaction with alcohol.

            	<img src="bs90.jpg" style="height: 22vh;" /> <span class="emph">Bob Surace '90</span>, a man who both won an Ivy League title as an All-Ivy center and met his future wife while at Princeton, returned to his beloved alma mater on Dec. 23, 2009 with the goal of restoring the football program to its past glory. Within four seasons, he achieved that mark in record-breaking fashion, and he has kept the Tigers as championship contenders ever since. Surace has placed 52 players on the last four All-Ivy League teams. A former NFL assistant coach at Cincinnati, Surace has also seen two top defensive linemen — Mike Catapano and Caraun Reid — get selected in the NFL Draft over the last four years. Surace guided Princeton to a historic 2013 Ivy League championship; the Tigers set Ivy League records in both total offense and scoring offense, and placed a league-best 17 players on the All-Ivy League team.

        	<h2>Schedule</h2>
            <h3>“Internet Voting? Really?”</h3>
            <h4>Andrew Appel</h4>
            <p>In this heated election year, Dr. Appel explores the history of voting and voting fraud as we have transitioned from paper ballots to mechanical voting machines. What does the future of voting and voting security look like in the United States?</p>
            <h3>“The Inspiration Paradox”</h3>
            <h4>Nusrat Ahmed</h4>
            <p>Why does Tumblr see an influx of love poems between 11pm and 2am? Why do we have major breakthroughs in the shower? Why did Sam Smith attribute his four Grammy wins to his previous heartbreak? Nusrat explores the different birthplaces of creativity, from mindfulness to sadness, and how we can apply our creativity to do good in the world.</p>
            <h3>“Sustaining Life with Genes & Proteins Designed ‘From Scratch’”</h3>
            <h4>Michael Hecht</h4>
            <p>Proteins are molecular machines that catalyze the essential processes of life.  Thanks to recent advances in synthetic biology, it is now possible to design entirely novel proteins encoded by fully synthetic genes.  Some of these novel proteins provide life-sustaining activities in vivo.  These findings suggest that (i) the molecular toolkit for life need not be limited to genes and proteins that already exist in nature, and (ii) novel life forms sustained by artificial genomes and proteomes may soon be possible.</p>
            <h3>“Pimp My… Trash Cart?”</h3>
            <h4>Mundano</h4>
            <h4><i>Screened TED Talk</i></h4>
            <p>In Brazil, "catadores" collect junk and recyclables. But while they provide a vital service that benefits all, they are nearly invisible as they roam the streets. Graffiti artist Mundano describes his project "Pimp My Carroça," which has transformed these heroic workers' carts into things of beauty and infused them with a sense of humor. It's a movement that is going global.</p>
            <h3>“Virtual Reality Storytelling”</h3>
            <h4>Kate Gardner</h4>
            <p>How is virtual reality (VR) changing the future of storytelling? Kate explores how viewers are drawn into an immersive story and why virtual reality will change the way future generations conceive of and produce stories.</p>
            <h3>Mixer</h3>
            <p>Refreshments, snacks, and enthusiastic sharing of ideas in the McCormick Lobby.</p>
            <h3>“Meet the Dazzling Flying Machines of the Future”</h3>
            <h4>Raffaello D’Andrea</h4>
            <h4><i>Screened TED Talk</i></h4>
            <p>When you hear the word "drone," you probably think of something either very useful or very scary. But could they have aesthetic value? Autonomous systems expert Raffaello D'Andrea develops flying machines, and his latest projects are pushing the boundaries of autonomous flight — from a flying wing that can hover and recover from disturbance to an eight-propeller craft that's ambivalent to orientation ... to a swarm of tiny coordinated micro-quadcopters. Prepare to be dazzled by flying machines that dance like fireflies.</p>
            <h3>“Education Through Football”</h3>
            <h4>Bob Surace</h4>
            <p>Controlling the controllables to best handle adversity, emphasizing attitude to best improve the culture of our team, and creating an obsessive competitive environment that puts the focus on personal best.</p>
            <h3>“Why Art Should Still Engage the Inner Life”</h3>
            <h4>Hyeseung Marriage-Song</h4>
            <p>Art can be evidence of what is universal between humans—what brings us together across different cultures, language and even time. My art may engage the intellect, but it is first and foremost designed to enrich the inner, emotional life of those who see it. And what a controversial proposition in this day and age.</p>
            <h3>“Taming Alcohol’s Dark Side”</h3>
            <h4>Brooks Powell</h4>
            <p>Have you ever considered the ethics surrounding humankind's relationship with matter? Attempting to use matter for our own advantage, how does the opposite sometimes occur? Using alcohol as a case study, Brooks investigates the interesting relationship between humankind and matter by exploring the various control-based relationships one can have with alcohol.</p>

			<p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called <a href="http://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program ">TEDx</a>. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDx[name], where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDx[name] event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.</p>
			
            <p><b>What is TED?</b></p>
            <p>TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.</p>
			<p>The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British Columbia, along with the TEDActive simulcast event in nearby Whistler. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TED Talks are posted daily; the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world get help translating their wishes into action; TEDx, which supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around the world, and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.</p>
